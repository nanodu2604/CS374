# CS374 project
This is the repository's final project of CS374, written by Java including LR Parsing and regular expression.
My plan is to make the terminal to add the interval, and expression see if the result is inside the interval or not.
Just kidding that my code so far cannot do the power and sqrt due to time limit. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
E.g:
```latex
$\exp{2},\sqrt{3}$
```
